# Top Note

Top Note is a widget-first productivity app that keeps you focused on what’s next—literally one thing at a time. Instead of endless to‑do lists you never look at, Top Note presents a single reminder, flashcard, or note right on your Home Screen widget.

## Why it works
Top Note introduces gentle friction: there’s no long list to cherry-pick from. You must either complete the next item or see it again soon, keeping important tasks and knowledge top-of-mind without overwhelming you.

- Skip & repeat — Skipped items return sooner so you can’t forget them.  
- Spaced repetition flashcards — Boost memory and recall with confidence-rated reviews.  
- Widget-first design — Most interactions happen directly from the Home Screen.  
- Flexible notes — Keep quotes, mantras, micro-goals, or short reminders visible all day.  
- Simple setup — Configure everything in the main app; use it primarily from the widget.
